## About me
<img src="assets/img/me.jpg" alt="my face and rocks">

I am a Phd candidate at the University of California Santa Cruz working with Emily Brodsky, Thorne Lay and Noah Finnegan. I study various problems under the umbrella of earthquake physics, hypothesis testing and forecasting.

## Research

### Earthquake Statistics

What causes some earthquakes to have more aftershocks than others? In <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=XsIHgIsAAAAJ">__this study__</a>, we systematically tested how attributes of a mainshock related to its setting (depth, plate boundary type, etc.) and its sources (stress drop, radiated energy, source dimensions, etc.) influence the number of aftershocks to come. We work towards a complimentary approach to aftershock forecasting that relies solely on attributes of the source instead of long term calibration. This project was funded by the NESRC Alexander Graham Bell fellowship.

### Fault Zone Geomorphology

Faults are iconic features of the landscape. Can we use their expression in the landscape to better understand them? I am using a combination of field observations, remote measurements and landscape evolution models to better characterize fault structure with a particular focus on fault zone damage. This project is funded by NASA's FINNEST fellowship.

### Fault Mechanics

Do faults smooth with cummulative displacement? In <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018JB015638">__this study__</a>, we leveraged faults in the San Rafael Desert as a natural laboratory to test this question. We measured the roughness of over a hundred slip surfaces using high resolution laser scanners. Our study provides clear evidence for smoothing of fault slip surfaces with cummulative offset.
