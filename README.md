### Instructions to deploy:
This site uses github pages to host off the master branch. To
change anything, simply commit changes to your master branch
and push them up to github

```sh
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "I'm making awesome changes cus I'm great"
$ git push origin master
```

Then go see if your changes are there after like a minute!
