# Kelian's Personal Website

### Instructions to deploy:
This site uses github pages to host off the master branch. To
change anything, simply commit changes to your master branch
and push them up to github

```sh
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "I'm making awesome changes cus I"m great"
$ git push origin master
```

Then go see if your changes are there! And if not, cry and maybe call Simon.
